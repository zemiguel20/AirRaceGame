# Plane Physics

To model the plane physics, the theory used came from a website from NASA Glenn Research Center. There are aspects which are simplified.

## Forces on an airplane during flight

While the plane is flying in the air, the [main 4 forces][1] responsible for his movement are:

- Weight
- Lift
- Drag
- Thrust

![plane forces][7]

[Weight][2] is a gravitational force applied by the Earth on the plane, with direction always to the center of Earth, and magnitude dependent on the plane's total weight.

[Thrust][3] is a mechanical force generated by a propulsion system, which is used to overcome the drag.
Normally, its created by the reaction to accelerating a mass of gas, having opposite direction of the movement of the accelerated gas.
The magnitude depends on the mass flow rate.

[Lift][4] is a mechanical aerodynamic force generated by the turning of air in the moving plane's path.
It is generated by every part of the plane, but most if is generated in the wings, and is applied on the center of pressure.
Its direction is perpendicular to the plane movement direction and perpendicular to the plane's lateral axis, and the magnitude depends on multiple factors, including the difference in velocity between the plane and air.

[Drag][5] is a mechanical aerodynamic force caused by various different factors, like friction, shape of the plane and induced drag, and is generated by every part of the plane.
Its direction is opposite to the plane movement direction and perpendicular to the plane's lateral axis, and magnitude depends on multiple factors, including the difference in velocity between the plane and air.

The following image shows a representation of both aerodynamic forces vectors.
![aerodynamic forces vectors][6]

There are 2 equations to calculate the Lift and Drag forces.

* ` L = Cl * A * 0.5 * r * V^2`

"The [lift equation][8] states that lift L is equal to the lift coefficient Cl times the density r times half of the velocity V squared times the wing area A."
The calculation of the coefficient involves multiple factors, so normally it is calculated experimentally.

* ` D = Cd * A * 0.5 * r * V^2`

"The [drag equation][9] states that drag D is equal to the drag coefficient Cd times the density r times half of the velocity V squared times the reference area A."
The calculation of the coefficient involves multiple factors, so normally it is calculated experimentally.
In this case, the reference area is the wing's.

## Plane rotation

The plane has control surfaces that allow the pilot to change the plane's orientation during flight.
The forces are applied in the center of pressure of the control surfaces, which are from a certain distance from the plane's center of gravity, generating torques that rotate the plane around the center of gravity on the respective axis.
The rudder rotates the plane in the yaw axis, the elevators in the pitch axis, and the ailerons in the roll axis. [(link)][10]

The axis are represented in the next image.
